## Projects
### Prospects and application of multivariate and reliability analyses to one health risk assessments of toxic elements
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13530-023-00199-0))

Developed statistical consults on the appropriate statistical tools based on the different datasets obtained from the field.

### A New Dagum-Cauchy{Exponential} Distribution
[Publication](http://public.paper4promo.com/id/eprint/1019/)

Used **R** to plot the pdf and cdf graphs, which showed the true properties of the new distribution. **R** was also used to obtain other important properties such as the plots of the reliability analysis and the maximum likelihood estimates using different datasets.
